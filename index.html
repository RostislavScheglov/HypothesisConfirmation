            By this script, I wanted to say that the number of people who take part in this hypothesis, 
            as well as the amount of money of these people had, and how much money they will give/get if they lose/win, 
            does not matter for confirming this hypothesis, 
            all the money of all people in the end will have 1 person.
        </p>
            <span class="question">Why are only 4 people involved in the script ?</span>
            <p class="bot-explain"> 
            As I wrote above, the number of people who take part in this hypothesis is not important for confirming it, 
            since flip coin is a pair game, only 2 people play it, 
            if there are 1000 people, it will form 500 pairs, in each sooner or later will be a winner with all money, 
            then other pairs will form and so on until the last pair has a winner with all the money, 
            there can be 4 and 10,000 people or more at will.
